    <p>About us:
        The aim of this website is to help keep old used clothes away from landfills. 
        It is my pride to find new homes for gently used items hence our moto "re-wearing is caring".
        We make it our responsibility to reduce chemical and carbon solutions and supporting charities that do good as we give back 15% of our profits to local charities
